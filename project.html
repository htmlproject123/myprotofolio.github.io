    <h4 style="color:indigo;font-size: 30px;">Description:</h4>
    <p>In Speech Emotion Recognition project, we propose a novel approach for speech emotion recognition by <u> learned features and deep long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in a clustering-based framework</u>. The recognition of a speaker's emotional state is a difficult task for machine learning algorithms, which are important in the field of speech emotion recognition (SER). SER is used to analyse the emotional state of speakers in many real-time applications such as human behaviour assessment, human-robot interaction, virtual reality, and emergency centres.</p>
